## Next part

Okey. Continue the code, only give me the next code for the docs next part. Continue the code like above, just to emphasize, the 'ðŸ”—' is the start of the next method, so the next would be `function client:{name}(...) end`. Here is docs next part for the methods to annotate:

## Continue code

Reminder of an example syntax:

```lua
--- The X window id.
---@type integer
---@readonly
---## Constraints
--- - Default value: This is generated by X11.
--- - Negative allowed: false
--- ---
--- [**View doc**](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/core_components/client.html#window)
client.window = nil
```

Continue the annotation code, only give the code starting from property and later:
`client.sticky`
